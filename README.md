# apigee
This project consists of two seperate projects that combined end up with a single porcess (-ish ðŸ˜Š).
The first is the APIGEE project along with its OpenAPI code.
The second is a larger Restful API prject (SpringBoot) that could be used to handle the database and provide query result ( in a JSON format).
